    The Eiffel Tower is an iron lattice tower located on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France.
    It was designed by the engineer Gustave Eiffel and completed in 1889 for the Exposition
    Universelle (World's Fair) held to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution.

    Standing over 300 meters tall, the Eiffel Tower became a global symbol of France and a
    major tourist attraction. Visitors can take elevators or climb stairs to observation decks
    that provide panoramic views of Paris. The tower is especially beautiful at night when
    thousands of lights sparkle every hour on the hour.
